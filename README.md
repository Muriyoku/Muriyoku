## Programming Languages:

Some languages I have experiece with. In case of Python, I have only the basic of language from my Data Structure studies. `JavaScript` and `TypeScript` are the languages whose I have more experience with. 

`Rust` and `C` are languages used to study about computer science concepts, but I have some experience with. In future I plan to masterize `Rust` or `C++`.  

I have some basic experiece with `Dart`, but I do not plan to study it after all.

## Tools 

Tools used to develop applications. I'm currently focusing on `Bun` runtime. I have many projects with `Node.js`, but its poor support in `TypeScript` make me study more about `Bun`. In the present momento, my operational system is `windows`, but I plan to study about `unix` systems. In addition, I have some basic experience with `powershell` and `bash` files.

## Learning

## Knowledge

I'm no longer a front-end developer. I'm learning more about web backend development. Currently, I'm focusing deeply on computer science concepts using `Rust` and `C`, and I no longer use any technology below them, though I am familiar with it.
